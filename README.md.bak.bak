## Running the Project with Docker

This project provides a Docker setup for running the Next.js/TypeScript application in a production-ready environment. The Docker configuration uses multi-stage builds for optimized image size and security.

### Requirements
- Docker (latest version recommended)
- Docker Compose (if using `compose.yaml`)

### Project-Specific Docker Details
- **Node.js Version:** 22.13.1 (as specified in the Dockerfile)
- **Exposed Port:** 3000 (the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`)
- **Environment Variables:**
  - The Docker Compose file references an optional `.env.local` file for environment variables. Uncomment the `env_file` line in `compose.yaml` if you need to provide custom configuration.

### Build and Run Instructions
1. **Build and start the app:**
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This will build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile` and start the application on port 3000.

2. **Access the app:**
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Customization
- If you need to provide environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the project root and uncomment the `env_file` line in `compose.yaml`.
- The Docker setup uses a non-root user for improved security.
- No external services (such as databases) are configured by default. If you add any, update `compose.yaml` accordingly.
